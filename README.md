# Advanced HTTP Testing Tool with Cloudflare Bypass

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
This tool is for **educational and testing purposes only**! Only use on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use may violate laws and terms of service.

## Features

### üöÄ Core Features
- **High Performance**: Concurrent request handling with configurable concurrency
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live monitoring of requests, responses, and performance
- **Session Management**: Cookie jar support for maintaining sessions
- **Proxy Support**: Rotating proxy support (coming soon)
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request rate limiting

### üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Bypass Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects Cloudflare protection automatically
- **Multiple Bypass Modes**:
  - `auto`: Intelligent header selection based on user agent
  - `stealth`: Minimal headers to avoid detection
  - `aggressive`: Many headers to confuse detection systems
  - `custom`: Use custom headers from configuration
- **JavaScript Challenge Handling**: Automatic handling of CF challenges
- **Advanced Headers**: Modern browser headers including sec-ch-ua
- **Session Persistence**: Save and load sessions for consistent bypass

| `-duration` | Attack duration | 60s |
| `-bypass` | Bypass mode (auto/stealth/aggressive/custom) | auto |
| `-rate` | Requests per second (0 = unlimited) | 0 |
| `-timeout` | Request timeout | 30s |
| `-session` | Session file for cookies | - |
| `-js-check` | Enable JavaScript challenge detection | true |
| `-challenge-delay` | Delay between challenge attempts | 5s |
| `-useragent` | Custom user agent file | - |
| `-proxy` | Proxy file (one per line) | - |

## Bypass Modes

### Auto Mode (Default)
Intelligently selects headers based on the user agent. Automatically detects browser type and applies appropriate headers.

### Stealth Mode
Uses minimal headers to avoid detection. Best for avoiding basic bot detection.

### Aggressive Mode
Uses many headers to confuse detection systems. May be more effective against some protection systems.

### Custom Mode
Uses headers from a custom configuration file. Allows full control over request headers.

## Configuration Files

### User Agent File
Create a text file with one user agent per line:
```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36
```

### Headers File
Create a JSON file with custom headers:
```json
{
  "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml",
  "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
  "Custom-Header": "value"
}
```

### Proxy File
Create a text file with one proxy per line:
```
http://proxy1:8080
http://proxy2:8080
socks5://proxy3:1080
```

## Examples

### Basic Load Testing
```bash
./advanced_http_tool -target=https://example.com -concurrency=50 -duration=60s
```

### Cloudflare Bypass Testing
```bash
./advanced_http_tool -target=https://protected-site.com -bypass=stealth -js-check=true
```

### High Performance Testing
```bash
./advanced_http_tool -target=https://example.com -concurrency=500 -rate=1000 -duration=300s
```

### Session-based Testing
```bash
./advanced_http_tool -target=https://example.com -session=my_session.json -bypass=auto
```
